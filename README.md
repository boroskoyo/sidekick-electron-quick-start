## About the project

This project aims to show how you can develop a custom application to control your Sidekick agents using Sidekick Node.js Client.

#### Built With

React
[Express](https://expressjs.com/)
Socket.io
Electron
[Sidekick Node.js Client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@runsidekick/sidekick-client)



#### Getting Started

This tutorial consists of 2 parts. First part is a standard web application that we will live debug and the second one is our custom Sidekick control app.


##### Prerequisites

 * Sidekick

        Make sure Sidekick broker is running. (check main Sidekick repo)
        If you have changed the default settings, update token and port values in this tutorial accordingly.

Check out our  [Quick Start Guide](https://medium.com/p/efc0845a2288).



##### Part-1 | Employee System (Main App)


```bash
# Clone Employee System repository
git clone https://github.com/boroskoyo/sidekick-example-employee-management-system
# Go into the repository
cd sidekick-example-employee-management-system
# Install dependencies
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
# Run the app
npm run start
```

UI will start running at http://localhost:3000 and backend will be using the port 8081

- `server/index.js` - This is where we include our Sidekick agent. You can edit the agent settings according to your setup and needs.


##### Part-2 | Control Application

This is the application we have built to control our Sidekick agent.

```bash
# Clone this repository
git clone https://github.com/boroskoyo/sidekick-electron-quick-start
# Go into the repository
cd sidekick-electron-quick-start
# Install dependencies
npm i --legacy-peer-deps
# Run the app
npm run dev-app
```

```bash
# You can also run the browser version - http://localhost:5173/
npm run dev
```


- `server.js` - Contains the main functions for putting Tracepoint.
- `params` - This is where we prepare our params for Sidekick API requests for putting tracepoints.
- `filename` - Filname paramters consists of git address of the file and the commit hash.

## Usage
After running all applications. Go to http://localhost:3000 and check out the employee app. Then use the put tracepoint buttons on the Electron app to put tracepoints on the running application.

1- Visit the home page and capture stack related to employee list endpoint.
2- Delete an employee to collect related data.
3- Check out Electron app to see your collected events.

You can than further edit those apps to explore Sidekick Client's features.
